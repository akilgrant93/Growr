It catches its prey by using its modified leaves that lie on the ground and have “densely covered stalked glands that bear a droplet of sticky mucilage on its top.” The need to capture arthropods is driven by the lack of nutrients present in the soil. P. l. subsp. longifolia obtain their nutrition primarily from flying insects, mainly diptera, which replenished the carnivorous plant with nitrogen. P. l. subsp. longifolia grows in wet shady areas and on vertical or overhanging limestone walls.  It has been found at altitudes between  –  meters.  In the spring, the winter buds open and the first carnivorous leaves present themselves.  These leaves are then followed by the flowers in early summer. Throughout summer the leaves can grow up to  cm in length and have glands present on both sides of the leaves, which is highly characteristic of P. l. subsp. longifolia.  More carnivorous leaves arise throughout summer, and when the conditions become unfavourable, around autumn, a protective winter casing composed of scale like leaves is produced, in the centre of the rosette, called the hibernacula, also known as the plant bud.  The leaves halt production and the old leaves wither and decay; P. l. subsp. longifolia is now ready for the winter dormancy.  There must be optimal growth during the summer for P. l. subsp. longifolia, otherwise they produce weakened hibernacula which rot very easily.","tags":["carnivorous"],"keywords":["p","pi","pin","ping","pingu","pingui","pinguic","pinguicu","pinguicul","pinguicula","pinguicula ","pinguicula l","pinguicula lo","pinguicula lon","pinguicula long","pinguicula longi","pinguicula longif","pinguicula longifo","pinguicula longifol","pinguicula longifoli","pinguicula longifolia"]},{"imgSrc":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Pinguicula_lusitanica.JPG/440px-Pinguicula_lusitanica.JPG","commonName":"Pinguicula lusitanica","family":"Lentibulariaceae","genus":"Pinguicula","species":"lusitanica","description":"Pinguicula lusitanica, commonly known as the pale butterwort, is a small butterwort that grows wild in acidic peat bog areas along coastal atlantic western Europe from western Scotland and Ireland south through western England and western France to the Iberian Peninsula and Morocco in north-western Africa.","tags":["carnivorous"],"keywords":["p","pi","pin","ping","pingu","pingui","pinguic","pinguicu","pinguicul","pinguicula","pinguicula ","pinguicula l","pinguicula lu","pinguicula lus","pinguicula lusi","pinguicula lusit","pinguicula lusita","pinguicula lusitan","pinguicula lusitani","pinguicula lusitanic","pinguicula lusitanica"]},{"imgSrc":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Pinguicula_lutea.jpg/440px-Pinguicula_lutea.jpg","commonName":"Pinguicula lutea","family":"Lentibulariaceae","genus":"Pinguicula","species":"lutea","description":"Pinguicula lutea, commonly known as the yellow butterwort, is a species of warm-temperate carnivorous plant in the family Lentibulariaceae.

It is usually found growing in the water-filled leaf axils of some species of bromeliad, including Brocchinia micrantha, B. tatei, and B. reducta and also plants in the genus Orectanthe. It also grows as an epiphyte on tree trunks or as a subaquatic or terrestrial species in shallow water or wet soil in open savanna. It is found mostly between altitudes of , m (, ft) and , m (, ft), though it has been found at altitudes as low as  m ( ft).

Since , U. inflata has been reported to exist in locations beyond its traditional range, such as the Adirondack Mountains in New York, southeastern Massachusetts, and in Washington State. Studies on the populations in the Adirondacks suggest that an introduction of U. inflata to a location where it naturalizes can lead to altered sediment chemistry by reducing the net primary productivity of native species.
